You can load the code in a fresh Pharo 7.0 image with:

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
        repository: 'github://PolyMathOrg/PolyMath:development/src';
        baseline: 'PolyMath';
        load
```

We have **799** green tests ! At the moment, all the development happens in the development branch.

PolyMath is a Pharo project, similar to existing scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy for Python or SciRuby for Ruby. PolyMath already provide the following basic functionalities:
- complex and quaternions extensions,
- random number generators,
- fuzzy algorithms,
- KDE-trees,
- Numerical methods,
- Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers.

A book about PolyMath called "PolyMath book" is available online: https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PolyMath-book

Some documentation (to be cleaned and reorganized) about PolyMath is available on the Wiki here: 
https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/PolyMath/wiki

Natalia wrote some explanation about benchmarking PolyMath in the Pharo For Enterprise Book: https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PharoForTheEnterprise-english/blob/ae40e7ab6f7651f6e7c271869eb1efc4e531e774/ComparingSolutions/ComparingSolutions.pier

## Install PolyMath

To install PolyMath in your Pharo image you can just execute the following script:

```Smalltalk
    Metacello new
        githubUser: 'PolyMathOrg' project: 'PolyMath' commitish: 'development' path: 'src';
        baseline: 'PolyMath';
        load
```

To add PolyMath to your baseline just add this:

```Smalltalk
    spec
    	baseline: 'PolyMath'
    	with: [ spec repository: 'github://PolyMathOrg/PolyMath:development/src' ]
```
