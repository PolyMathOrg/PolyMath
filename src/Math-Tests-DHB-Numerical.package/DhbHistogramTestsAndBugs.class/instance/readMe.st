"DhbHistogram is insofar a bit problematic as for most methods it first needs the cache to be flushed by hand, but DhbHistogram is used by some other dhb objects that tend to forget to do this. hence i had to add some minimum amount of flushCache routines, so that everything works properly which is tested here (and things didnt slowdown, i made some routines a tiny bit faster). since the cache gets flushed automatically when the cache is full and the default cachesize is 100 and with 100 datapoints there is no noticable speed difference with using a cache, i would guess that the author had set the default size so low that the routines would work in most cases (but - well - just in most cases). anyway i did not change the default cache size. a real bug was corrected and tested in testCountsBetween and also in testDhbHistogrammedDistribution ."
